Arduino Sketch for the GMSN! Pure ADSR
This version Andy Cobley andy@r2-dvd.org

This version calcuates the slopes differently, the matsh should allow the curve to be adjusted from exponential to linear to logrithmic.

The Plan is:

Switch in upper position, knobs control time for curve to complete
Switch in middle position, exp/lin/Log amout, Sustain works as hold, 0 hold on left, gated hold fully right
Switch in Bottom position, repeat envelope after complete.

NOTE
This is a work in progress, the code has not yet been tested !
