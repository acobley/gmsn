Arduino Sketch for the GMSN! Pure ADSR
This version Andy Cobley andy@r2-dvd.org

This version calcuates the slopes differently, the math should allow the curve to be adjusted from exponential to linear to logrithmic.

Interface

Switch in upper position, knobs control time for curve to complete
Switch in bottom position, exp/lin/Log amount, Sustain works as hold, gated on fully left left, otherwise set time
Switch in middle position, repeat envelope after complete.

Pressing the front switch will save the envlope slope coefficients to EEPROM

NOTE
TAG 0.951 Fixed release start from delay level 
TAG 0.95  Save to EEPROM
TAG 0.91  First Working release

To Be Completed
Sustain does not yet work as a hold.
Repeat mode does not work
