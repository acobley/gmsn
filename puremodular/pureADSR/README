Arduino Sketch for the GMSN! Pure ADSR
This version Andy Cobley andy@r2-dvd.org

Interface

Switch in upper position, knobs control time for curve to complete
Switch in middle position, exp/lin/Log amout, Sustain works as hold, 0 hold on left, gated hold fully right
Switch in Bottom position, repeat envelope after complete.

Pressing the front switch will save the envlope slope coefficients to EEPROM

NOTE
TAG 0.951 Fixed release start from delay level 
TAG 0.95  Save to EEPROM
TAG 0.91  First Working release

Branch b0.951 should match tag 0.951 (Sketch name may be wrong)
master branch is experimental

To Be Completed
Sustain does not yet work as a hold.
Repeat mode does not work
